B: BECs are simulated in second quantisation, using approximate Bose gas ground states
P: difficult to compare approximate states to exact Lieb-Liniger wavefunction
C: can't estimate uncertainty in BEC simulations

everything else is geometry

elongated plane line
transverse area
scale to healing length
Lieb-Linger γ
	inverse square of bosons per healing length
	classical field limit is small γ with many bosons in each classical field feature

one-dimensional mean field is unphysical

density

Lieb-Liniger ground state
	exact first-quantised wave function
	Hellmann-Feynman theorem

approximations to the second quantised field

strong classical limit γ « 1
	approximate field as coherent state
	order parameter is coherent amplitude

weak classical limit γ ≲ 1
correlated positions
Bogoliubov squeezed state

expectation values in the ground state are stationary
computed dynamics can test the approximations
uniform density strongly constrained by energy
Glauber second order coherence function
	this is proportional to repulsion energy for contact potentials

Daltonian nitpicking

second order binomial expansion in order parameter and fluctuations
Bogoliubov = squeezing transform
linear dispersion long wavelength
sound wave modes

quasiparticles

Bogoliubov Hamiltonian
rotating squeezed orbitals

limit of tight confinement
small extent
	bogoliubov approximation doesn't have a consistent limit
	Lieb-Liniger limit?
quartic oscillator
	amplitude decays
	first and second order coherence are conserved

intermediate regime

truncated Wigner
classical probability density
good approximation with many bosons per field mode
Monte-Carlo Gross Pitaevskii equation

TW quadratures compared to quartic oscillator

Bogoliubov much steadier even in strong classical limit
fixed shape of oscillations in strong classical limit
	as γ varies with constant L/ξ, the coherent state quasiparticle modes are constant, and all that changes is the condensate density
	extra repulsion energy of coherent state has to go somewhere, becomes kinetic energy, causes fluctuations
similar in weak classical limit

At γ = 0.1, g² recovers over time in both initial conditions.  This is wierd, because the initial Bogoliubov g² is exact to within a few percent

Conclusions
be careful about deducing correlations from coherent states
