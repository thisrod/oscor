# Introduction

Bose-Einstein condensate

order parameter

interference (mention experiments in passing)

coherent state (or number state) is the limit of non-interacting bosons
interacting bosons occupy multiple orbitals

density correlations

low-dimensional geometry

other theory

# The interacting Bose gas in one dimension

Hamiltonian
scattering length
field operator

dispersion relation, scaled units

coherent state
Dirac-Frenkel
classical field
order parameter satisfies Gross-Pitaevskii equation

healing length, smallest scale of classical field
all other classical parameters are properties of the apparatus holding the gas
extent of unform gas
scale to healing length, dimensionless

cigar shaped trap
transverse area
Lieb-Linger γ
	inverse square of bosons per healing length
	classical field limit is small γ with many bosons in each classical field feature

one-dimensional mean field is a physical limit
spatial coherence is how the limit is approached

# The ground state

Lieb-Liniger ground state
	exact first-quantised wave function
	Hellmann-Feynman theorem

many-particle theory in terms of the second quantised field, need approximations that are tractable in second quantisation

# The coherent approximation

strong classical limit γ « 1
	approximate field as coherent state
	order parameter is coherent amplitude

gets density right

Daltonian nitpicking

# The Bogoliubov approximation

weak classical limit γ ≲ 1
correlated positions
Bogoliubov squeezed state gets g² more nearly right

Bogoliubov 1947, Stoler 1971

second order binomial expansion in order parameter and fluctuations
Bogoliubov Hamiltonian
Bogoliubov = squeezing transform
linear dispersion long wavelength
sound wave modes
Bogoliubov sound speed is √2
	scaled frequency of a mode is κ / √2
	independent of γ for all wavelengths
quadratic dispersion short wavelength
quasiparticles

# Stationary dynamics as a test

want an independent test of the validity of these approximations

expectation values in the ground state are stationary
computed dynamics can test the approximations
uniform density strongly constrained by energy
Glauber second order coherence function
	this is proportional to repulsion energy for contact potentials

Different number states have evolving relative phase
limit of tight confinement
small extent
	bogoliubov approximation doesn't have a consistent limit
	Lieb-Liniger limit?
quartic oscillator
	amplitude decays
	first and second order coherence are conserved

Dynamics of a coherent state in the Bogoliubov approximation
	rotating squeezed orbitals
	oscillating numbers in non-condensate orbitals

# Truncated Wigner dynamics

Independent approximation
truncated Wigner
classical probability density
good approximation with many bosons per field mode
Monte-Carlo Gross Pitaevskii equation

# Results

XSPDE

Occupations of noncondensate orbitals in TW dynamics, with Bogoliubov dispersion curve for comparison.  (See tplot.m for how to sharpen frequency peaks.)

Table of second-order coherence plots.  Independent variables are Lieb-Liniger γ, condensate size in healing lengths, and coherent vs Bogoliubov initial conditions.  (Maybe talk about the "first order ground state" and "second order ground state".)

Quadrature graphs to illustrate that no expansion around a coherent state is anything like stationary.  Tie this back to the Dalton issues: total particle number shifts the chemical potential and therefore the quantum phase.

Total energy plots.  Cite TW conservation laws paper.

# Experimental possibilities

Can set up a coherent state, then turn on repulsion

# Conclusion

TW quadratures compared to quartic oscillator

Bogoliubov much steadier even in strong classical limit
fixed shape of oscillations in strong classical limit
	as γ varies with constant L/ξ, the coherent state quasiparticle modes are constant, and all that changes is the condensate density
	extra repulsion energy of coherent state has to go somewhere, becomes kinetic energy, causes fluctuations
similar in weak classical limit

At γ = 0.1, g² recovers over time in both initial conditions.  This is wierd, because the initial Bogoliubov g² is exact to within a few percent

Conclusions
be careful about deducing correlations from coherent states


# Trimmings

How do you project out a fixed total particle number from a Bogoliubov state?  I guess that, when a large trap has a fixed total particle number, each short section of it has a Bogoliubov superposition of non-condensate densities, just as it would have a coherent-state superposition in the noninteracting case.
